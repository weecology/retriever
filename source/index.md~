EcoData Retriever
===============================

### Finding data is one thing. Getting it ready to use is another. EcoData Retriever does the work so that you can focus on doing science.

Most ecological datasets do not adhere to any agreed-upon standards in
format, data structure or method of access. As a result acquiring and
utilizing available datasets can be a time consuming and error prone
process. The EcoData Retriever automates the tasks of finding,
downloading, and cleaning up ecological data files, and then stores them
in a local database. The automation of this process reduces the time for
a user to get most large datasets up and running by hours, and in some
cases days. Small datasets can be downloaded and installed in seconds
and large datasets in minutes. The program also cleans up known issues
with the datasets and automatically restructures them into standard
formats before inserting the data into your choice of database
management systems (Microsoft Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, on
Windows, Mac and Linux).
