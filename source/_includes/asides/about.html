  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Bill Patrianakos. I'm a web developer working in Chicago. I also founded <a href="http://chooseclever.com">my own small business</a> and I'm on the board of directors for a <a href="http://theherofoundation.org">non-profit</a>. This is where I come to share my thoughts, experiences, and hopefully help and/or inspire others.
