<div class="toplevel"><div>
<p>The EcoData Retriever system is a Python library created to simplify 
downloading and importing ecological data. There's a lot of publically 
available data out there, and the speed at which we can add new datasets is
limited. We've made it easy for developers to develop their own custom dataset 
scripts.</p>
<p>This document is a resource for Python developers or ecologists interested 
in developing scripts for use with the EcoData Retriever.</p>
<p><i>We encourage users who develop their own scripts to submit them to the 
Retriever team, so that they can be used by other researchers in future 
distributions.</i></p>
<h2>API Documentation</h2> 
<p>Read the <a href="retriever.html">API documentation</a> for help with the 
EcoData Retriever API.</p>
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>The EcoData Retriever platform is divided into three packages:
<ul>
<li>The core modules, located in <a href="retriever.lib.html">retriever.lib</a></li>
<li>"Engines" to customize actions for a particular DBMS in <a href="retriever.engines.html">retriever.engines</a></li>
<li>A wxPython-based GUI in <a href="retriever.ui.html">retriever.app</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The platform dynamically loads dataset scripts from Python (.py) files found
in the "scripts" directory. Each script contains instructions to access a
different dataset; if you need a dataset that's not yet supported, you can
create your own script in the "scripts" directory and it will show up
automatically.</p>
<h3>A simple example</h3>
<p>The EcoData Retriever platform was developed to take the most effort out of
the most common tasks in importing data. As an example, the Ernest Mammal
Life History dataset, one of our standard scripts, is implemented here in just
<b>3 lines of code</b> (expanded for clarity):</p>
<pre>
from retriever.lib.templates import BasicTextTemplate

VERSION = '0.5'

SCRIPT = BasicTextTemplate(
                           name="Mammal Life History Database (Ecological Archives 2003)",
                           description="S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.",
                           shortname="MammalLH",
                           urls = {"species": "http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt"}
                           )
</pre>
<p>Here's a simple walkthrough of what's going on in this script:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <pre>from retriever.lib.templates import BasicTextTemplate</pre>
        The <b>BasicTextTemplate</b> class contains all of the functionality
        needed to download raw data files, create database tables, and import
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>SCRIPT = BasicTextTemplate( ... )</pre>
        The Retriever looks for this variable, SCRIPT, when it loads scripts;
        SCRIPT should be an instance of the Script class found in retriever.lib.models 
        (or another class that inherits from this class, such as BasicTextTemplate.)
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>name=..., description=..., shortname=...</pre>
        These keyword arguments give basic information about the script.
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>urls = {"species": "http://..."}</pre>
        The BasicTextTemplate class uses the urls dictionary to create
        tables. Each key represents the name of a table to be created; each
        value represents the URL of the raw data file, which will be automatically
        parsed for column names, data types, etc. Note that because Python
        dictionaries are unordered, these tables will be downloaded in no
        particular order.<br/>
        Optionally, another dictionary called tables can also be passed if the
        Retriever is unable to automatically determine the structure of the table
        that should be created. Using the table names as key arguments, each value 
        should be an instance of the Table class found in retriever.lib.models.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Adding scripts to the Retriever</h2>
<p>If you've developed a script and you'd like it to be accessible from the 
Retriever's GUI, just place it in the scripts directory and it will be loaded 
automatically when the Retriever is started. If there are any problems with your
script it will not be shown.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The EcoData Retriever system also contains a helper class, ScriptTest, for 
use in unit testing.</p>
<p>As with the development of the scripts themselves, the development of unit 
tests has also been streamlined. The class is meant to run a script, import the 
data from the newly created database, and test it against a text file containing 
manually imported data.</p>
<p>See the scripts included in the EcoData Retriever distribution for examples 
of test classes.</p>
<p>To run all tests, you'll first need to add your script, as explained in the 
section <b>Adding scripts to the main wizard</b>. Running tests.py will run all 
unit tests found in these scripts.</p>
