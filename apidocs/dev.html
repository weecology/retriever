<p>The Database Toolkit system is a Python library created to simplify downloading and importing ecological 
data. There's a lot of publically available data out there, so we're limited by the number of datasets 
we've implemented. We've designed the system to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add their own 
custom dataset scripts.</p>
<p>This document is a resource for Python developers interested in developing scripts for use with
the Database Toolkit.</p>
<p><i>We encourage users who develop their own scripts to submit them to the Database
Toolkit team, so that they can be used by other researchers in future distributions.</i></p>
<h2>Understanding the API</h2> 
<p>Read the <a href="dbtk.html">API documentation</a> for help with the Database Toolkit API.</p>
<h2>DBTK Scripts</h2>
<p>The Database Toolkit platform is divided into four packages:
<ul>
<li>The core modules, located in <a href="dbtk.lib.html">dbtk.lib</a></li>
<li>"Engines" to customize actions for a particular DBMS in <a href="dbtk.engines.html">dbtk.engines</a></li>
<li>A wxPython-based GUI in <a href="dbtk.ui.html">dbtk.ui</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The platform dynamically loads dataset scripts from Python (.py) files found in the scripts directory.</p>
Developers can use the dbtk.lib functionality to
create their own individual scripts representing datasets not yet implemented in the DBTK
platform.</p>
<h3>A simple example</h3>
<p>The Database Toolkit platform was developed to take the most effort out of the most common
tasks in importing data. A simple, automated Database Toolkit script can be implemented using just
<b>14 lines of code</b>:</p>
<pre>
from dbtk import ENGINE_LIST
from dbtk.lib.tools import DbTk
from dbtk.ui.wizard import launch_wizard


class main(DbTk):
    name = "Mammal Life History Database (Ecological Archives 2003)"
    shortname = "MammalLH"
    url = "http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/Mammal_lifehistories_v2.txt"
    def download(self, engine=None):
        DbTk.download(self, engine)
        self.engine.auto_create_table(self.url, "species")
        self.engine.insert_data_from_url(self.url)
        return self.engine

if __name__ == "__main__":
    launch_wizard([main()], ENGINE_LIST())
</pre>
<p>This simple script will launch the dataset download wizard, allowing the user to choose
a DBMS and enter connection information, then downloads and imports the Mammal Life History
Database dataset.</p>
<p>Note that this example uses the <i>auto_create_table</i> function. This function
simplifies imports of text files by automatically determining column names and data types,
and will only work on files that have the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>The file uses a common delimiter: tabs, commas, and whitespace are all acceptable.</li>
<li>The first row contains a delimited list of column names.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last two lines are used when running the script directly. The launch_wizard function
will bring up the dataset download wizard, and takes two arguments: the first is a list of
datasets the user can choose from (if only one, no choice will be offered), and the second is
a list of approved DBMS (or ENGINE_LIST from the dbtk package, which is a list of all implemented 
DBMS).</p>
<h2>Adding scripts to the main wizard</h2>
<p>If you've developed a script and you'd like it to be accessible from the default dbtk
wizard on your system, just place it in the scripts directory and it will be loaded automatically.
Note that your script must contain a class called main that inherits from
the DbTk class found in dbtk.lib.tools.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The Database Toolkit system also contains a helper class, DbTkTest, for use in unit testing.</p>
<p>As with the development of the scripts themselves, the development of unit tests has also
been streamlined. The class is meant to run a script, import the data from the newly created
database, and test it against a text file containing manually imported data.</p>
<p>See the scripts included in the Database Toolkit distribution for examples of test classes.</p>
<p>To run all tests, you'll first need to add your script, as explained in the section
<b>Adding scripts to the main wizard</b>. Running tests.py will run all unit tests found in these
scripts.</p>
